# Shapley Values

Assume there's a predictive model have a $\vec{x}\space(x1, x2, x3)$ as the input variables, and $y$ as the corresponding variabe.
Below is the sample ouput:

| x1 | x2 | x3 | y | $\hat y$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 2.5 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 10 | 10 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 15 | 17.5 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 20 | 22.5 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 30 | 30 |
